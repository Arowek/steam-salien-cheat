# steam-salien-cheat
Simulates the playing of the "Summer Saliens" game on steam. Automatically chooses a planet/zone that will give you the max exp. Will switch between planets/zones once they're completed.

## Steps
1. Visit https://steamcommunity.com/saliengame/gettoken when logged in and get the `token` value
2. Enter the `token` on `line 6` in `saliens.py`
3. Open a command line/terminal and run the program as `python saliens.py`

#### Note:
- You need to have python installed
- You need to run `pip install requests` to get the requests module, before you can run the script

### Join Zone Error?
- Stop the script, wait 2 minutes, then re-run 
- OR, leave the script running and wait for the 2 minute cooldown to finish
